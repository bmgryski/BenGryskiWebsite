        <p> This longform infographic attempts to give further insight to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This longform infographic contains a series of near real-time event data along with sentiement and stability informamtion represented at the country scale in Eastern Europe. Using a bivariate symbology I had aimed to find underlying negative sentiment and stability indicators driven by the ongoing events in Easter Europe. Not only were there a large increase of conflict and unrest events due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, large migrations of Ukraine citizens has flooded and impacted other countries within Eastern Europe as they try to manage large quantities of refugees. </p>

        <p> This race brochure overviews a 21 day bike tour in the Southern Portion of Alaska and parts of the Yukon Region of Canada. This bike tour is seperated into three seven-day legs where those competeing will bike through the state of Alaska, starting in Homer, and make their way to Fairbanks then Juno over the course of the race. The first leg of the race begins in Homer Alaska on the peir, bbikers will the proceed over the next seven days to Fairbanks, Alaska where bikers will be given a rest day to recoop. Bikers will then proceed to complete the first loop passing Anchorage and proceeding to Valdez as the final stop of this trecherous leg. Bikers will then be given a day to transport themselves to Delta Junction where the final leg of the race will proceed. The final leg is a beast of its own. Bikers will race seven long days Tananacross, Alaska, over the border into Canada's Yukon region and back into the United States finishing the tour in Juno, Alaska. While this race has never been done (to my knowledge at least) it will be an incredibly challegeing task convering a variety of harsh terrain. </p>
